    <h1>Anatomy of an <i>Intervention</i>, onscreen and off</h1>
    <h2>By: Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        In the 13 years since it first aired, A&E’s <i>Intervention</i> has become a cultural touchstone for its nearly three million viewers. Its formula has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69PXpLtd-Ew">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXZocIK5gQ">referenced</a> <a href="https://www.memecenter.com/fun/1723211/the-intervention">and</a> <a href="http://southpark.cc.com/clips/307806/towelies-intervention">parodied</a>, and its <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/5-unforgettable-episodes-of-intervention.html">best-known episodes</a> have been <a href="http://intervention-directory.com/">dissected endlessly online</a>. It’s even spawned <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/intervention">memes</a> based on memorable moments and characters.
      </p>

       <p>
        Most importantly, <i>Intervention</i> introduced the viewing public to its namesake: the emotional, high-stakes confrontation at the climax of every episode, in which an addict’s loved ones beseech them to enter treatment. 
      </p>

       <p>
        “The middle of the country would never know what an intervention was without the show,” said Lee FitzGerald, an interventionist who’s appeared on the show. Now, she says, when she performs interventions, “the client comes in the room and they go, ‘Oh, I’ve seen the show, this is an intervention!’”
      </p>

       <p>
        But for all its educational value, <i>Intervention</i> is still subject to the same pressures as any other primetime TV title, say sources who’ve appeared on the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interviews with people who’ve worked on <i>Intervention</i> reveal significant differences between the interventions portrayed on the show and interventions that happen off-camera. But the interventionists interviewed have varying views of just how much the two differ. Some, like Rod Espudo, an interventionist who worked on nine episodes of <i>Intervention</i>, claim that the show distorts and misrepresents real-life interventions to better fit the reality TV format.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The interventions you see on TV are good for one thing,” Espudo said in a phone conversation. “Entertainment.”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Others, like Lee FitzGerald and Sylvia Parsons, say that the differences between the two are more modest and mostly have to do with fitting a multi-day process into a single television episode.
      </p> 

      <p>
        “The television show is actually two weeks of filming and probably three days of the actual intervention,” Parsons explained in an email. “This is edited down to the 45-50 minutes of TV time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        These conflicting opinions make it difficult to suss out exactly how much real-life and TV interventions differ. But by contrasting the interventions we see on the show with interventionists’ accounts of offscreen interventions, we can see for ourselves where exactly <i>Intervention’s</i> creators bend reality to better fit the mold of reality TV.

    <h3>The pre-intervention</h3>
    <p>
      Before the intervention, the addict's loved ones meet with the interventionist. They get a high-level overview of how the intervention will go, plan out their remarks, and agree on consequences for the addict if they refuse treatment.

  <h3>The intervention</h3>

  <p>
      The next day, the production team brings the unwitting addict to the intervention location, where they're confronted by their loved ones and the interventionists. Together, they do their best to convince the addict to accept the offer of treatment, which A&E pays for. If a loved one is also struggling with addiction, they'll often be offered treatment as well.
