    <h1>Anatomy of an <i>Intervention</i>, onscreen and off</h1>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        In the 13 years since it first aired, A&E’s <i>Intervention</i> has become a cultural touchstone. Its formula—particularly its namesake confrontation, in which an addict’s loved ones beseech them to enter treatment—has been endlessly referenced and parodied, its interventionists have become household names, and its memorable episodes and characters have been dissected endlessly online.
      </p>

       <p>
        With millions of viewers at the show's peak, there's no question that <i>Intervention</i> has shaped society’s perceptions of addiction, treatment, and recovery. But perhaps its most significant contribution is introducing us to its namesake: the emotional, high-stakes confrontation at the climax of every episode. Indeed, interventionist Jeff Vanvonderen said in an oral history of the show that he originally signed on as a way to get the word out about intervention as a way to get a loved one into treatment.

        But regardless of the interventionists' intentions, <i>Intervention</i> is still subject to the same pressures as any other primetime TV show.

        “The interventions you see on TV are good for one thing,” said Rod Espudo, an interventionist who worked on nine episodes of the show, in a phone conversation. “Entertainment.”

        By contrasting the interventions we see on the show with interventionists’ accounts of offscreen interventions, we can see where exactly the show’s creators bend reality to better fit the mold of reality TV. Click around the images to learn about interventions and to see where the show differs from reality.

    <h2>The pre-intervention</h2>
    <p>
      Before the intervention, the addict's loved ones meet with the interventionist. They get a high-level overview of how the intervention will go, plan out their remarks, and agree on consequences for the addict if they refuse treatment.
